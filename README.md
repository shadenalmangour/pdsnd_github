### Project Title

Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

In this project, Python code was written to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. Also, write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#### 2 Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#### 3 Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

#### 4 User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
